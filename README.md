This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges in TypeScript.
Advent of Code is a fun way to celebrate the holiday season while sharpening programming skills. 🎁

-
* Improve analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Each day has its own folder with the following structure:

* challenge.txt: The puzzle description for the day.
